# Weather_API

Use of weather API to analyze temperature changes depending on the location

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I used the random library from Python and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

I ended up with these different scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

A final scatter plots containing all these informations
